# SAMPLE Spring boot with graphql and Front-end

This is a sample project to showcase usage of `GraphQL` in Spring. To run the fontront end you may need to clone `frontend` project as well.
The backend and frontend project however can be run independently. To display backend data in web, we need both project to run.
Without Frontend, graphql data can be accessed via ## http://localhost:8084/graphiql?path=/graphql
